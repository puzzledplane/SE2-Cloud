- Project Synopsis: -
---------------------

With the current obesity epidemic in America, it is more important then ever that people are made 
conscious of the amount of exercise which they recieve. Therefore, this application keeps track of 
the number of steps the user has walked. It displays this data both visually, and with a audio 
interface. The data is then sent to a cloud server for future evaluation and visulization.

--------------------------------------------------
- Cloud Installation and Execution Instructions: -
--------------------------------------------------

1. Install a stable and reliable physical server or VPS environment with adequate hardware
to handle tasks and a proper operating system environment.
	a. If running a virtual environment on AWS. Please follow the following 
	b. Create an EC2 instance with the proper system resources and operating system 
	c. Apply security settings including opening inbound ports 80, 21, 443, 25 and 20.
	d. Give the instance an elastic IP so that it retains its static IP after restart.
2. Install desired HTTP server (i.e. Apache, nginx, etc...).
3. Configure HTTP server to quality standards including adding SSL security to make a 
proper HTTPS connection so data isnâ€™t transmitted in plain text.
4. Install PHP so that the system can function. 
5. Install PHP MySql libraries. Do not use mysql functions to connect to the database as 
these are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of PHP.
6. Install and Configure a MySQL server. Be sure to set up proper security features such as 
disabling root access from remote locations and giving passwords to MySQL users. Also, 
add SSL security when communicating with MySQL server.
7. Move PHP files in HTTP public folder to be displayed.
8. Change config.php to personal database information.
9. Import DBSchema.sql into MySQL database.

- To use existing instance on AWS EC2 Cloud : -
-----------------------------------------------

An existing development server has been create on AWS instance.

To run it:

1. Login to AWS
2. Click EC2
3. Click running instances
4. In the filter by tags and attributes or search by keyword, type cloud and hit enter. 
	a. Look for the name: Cloud Server - Group 1 - Software Engineering II - Fall 2015
	b. Right click that result, go to instance state and choose start to turn it on.
5. It will take a minute to boot, but once it is running you can access the site itself at: 
http://se2dev.no-ip.org/ or http://52.4.149.112
6. Username and password is currently "test" and "test".

- Sensor/Data Aggregator Installation and Execution Instructions: -
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies: Android >= 4.4

1. Download Java(SDK, JRE) from oracle website.
2. Download Android Studio and its SDK.
3. Open the "BatchStepSensor" in Android Studio (this is the final project). 
Plug your Android device into the computer. Press the "Run" button, and select your device.
4. When the app starts, a dialog will appear, requesting your username and password. 
	a. IMPORTANT: Currently, the username and password are both "test". 
	b. After logging in, you may now use the application.
Optional Voice Control: Select "Speech Input" from the menu dialog, wait until you here a 
beeping noise, then say "step count". A voice will tell you the current number of steps.
